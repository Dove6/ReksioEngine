# ReksioEngine

This project is an effort to reimplement the BlooMoo and Piklib engines, both used in the "Przygody Reksia" video game series. The goal is to enable the game to run directly in a web browser, utilizing its original assets and scripts. In addition to making the game accessible on modern platforms such as web browsers and mobile devices, the project also contributes to documenting and preserving the game engine and its custom scripting language, helping to understand and archive the inner workings of the technology behind the game.

While the game is not fully playable yet - you can have a look at the current progress here: \
